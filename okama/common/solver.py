class Result:
    """
    The result of finding a solution for `find_the_largest_withdrawals_size()`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    success : bool
        Whether or not the solver exited successfully.

    withdrawal_abs : float
        The absolute amount of withdrawal size (the best solution found).
        It is the first withdrawal value (before it was indexed in IndexationStrategy).

    withdrawal_rel : float
        The relative amount of withdrawal size (the best solution found).
        The first withdrawal value (before it was indexed in IndexationStrategy) divided by the initial investment.

    error_rel : float
        Characterizes how accurately the goal is fulfilled. The goal is set in the parameters.

    solutions : pd.DataFrame
        The history of attempts to find solutions (withdrawal values and error level).
